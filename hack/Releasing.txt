Prerequisites
-------------

1. Get a dockerhub account if you don't have one.  Ask to be added to
   the fission dockerhub account.

2. Get a Github "personal access token":
   https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/

   Save the token to ~/.gh-access-token (make sure that the file is
   readable only by you)

3. Go toolchain set up.

   The ability to build docker images.

   `docker login` with your own username; get this username added to
   the fission team on dockerhub.
   
4. Install changelog generator tool "github_changelog_generator": https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator

5. Install realpath if you don't already have it : https://github.com/harto/realpath-osx

6. Install gothub if you don't already have it : https://github.com/itchio/gothub 
   You just have to go get github.com/itchio/gothub, that'll install gothub in $GOPATH/bin. Ensure this is already
   in $PATH env variable.


Check that the build is green!
------------------------------

Fix if not, etc.


Update versions
---------------

Update the version in the helm charts:

In each charts, the version is in Chart.yaml, values.yaml and
templates/NOTES.yaml.

Commit your changes, push them, open a PR, merge it.

Update doc versions: Docs live at github.com/fission/docs.fission.io


Update the docs versions
------------------------

Archive existing version into dist/

Change config.toml baseURL.

Change versions in links.

git add, git commit.


Make the release
----------------


1. cd to the top of the repo, create a branch:

   git checkout -b vX.Y.Z

   Commit & push the version changes.

2. Run

   ./hack/release.sh <VERSION>

   This script checks to make sure you're releasing from the vX.Y.Z
   branch, and that your repo is clean (no modified/staged files).

   This will take a while.

3. Push docs update to github

4. Copy over charts from build dir into charts repo [see below], update helm chart index, push to github

5. Manually test an installation, just for a sanity check

6. Git commit and push Changelog.md into master branch.

7. Switch the github release from pre-release to release.

8. Add links from release notes:
   * Install guide in docs
   * Changelog.md

Update chart repo
-----------------

Copy the helm charts over to the fission-charts repo

Run `index.sh` in that repo.  (Don't edit the index.yaml in this repo
manually.  index.sh generates it, using the helm repo CLI.)

git add, git commit, and git push your changes.

The chart repo is a github page : https://github.com/fission/fission-charts, so once you push the master branch,
you're all set.

Ask to be added to this repo if permissions are missing.


Announce the release
--------------------

Announce the release on #contributors.


Update Fission.io
-----------------

Tell #marketing channel to update link
